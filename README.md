# RetroSwitch
# A custom open source retro game console in the body of a 3D printed nintendo switch case

---------------------------
This project is powered by:
---------------------------

- raspberry pi - doesnt matter which model you use as long as it supports retropie adn the 7 inch raspberry pi official display
- 2 Arduino pro micros
- Official raspberry pi 7 inch display
- Batteries that i still havent chosen yet
- buttons of any choice
- joystick modules
- usb hub
- wires
Optional:
  usb hub,
  hdmi cable,
  led diodes
  - explained later in the final assembly

Good to know:

Full diagram pro micro.png is a compilation of the other 2 files. The other files show the diagrams separately to make you life easier. On the schematic is shown an arduino Leonardo which has the same pinout as the pro micro. Thus you can do this with pro micros! (I did it with pro micros). You will need 2 pro micros for this project - one on the left side, one on the right side. The reason I chose to simulate keyboard presses with the Arduino Pro Micro is because you can replace the raspberry pi with another single board computer lithe the Latte Panda, Orange Pi or others.

Caution!!!
----------

Do not try to overclock or boost performace in any way except if you know what you are doing!!! Overclocking may cause overheating with unproper cooling (This 3D model  doesn't have the best airflow!)
